                - GNU Health combines the daily medical practice with state-of-the-art 
        technology in bioinformatics and genetics. It provides a holistic approach 
        to the  person, from the biological and molecular basis of disease to 
        the social and environmental determinants of health.
        
        GNU Health also manages the internal processes of a health institution, 
        such as calendars, financial management, billing, stock management, 
        pharmacies or laboratories (LIMS)
        
        The **GNU Health Federation** allows to interconnect heterogeneous nodes
        and build large federated health networks across a region, province
        or country.
